at|Welcome to the reconstructed bridge movies of the 1987 Bermuda Bowl Final - made possible by the wonderful Bridgebase technology of Fred Gitelman - our grateful thanks to Fred. For more info on Bridgebase visit www.bridgebase.com

On each board, Bidding is hidden until you press the Next Page button; this allows you to bid the hands yourself with modern methods

The user must be aware of a fundamental difference of the reconstructed lin files as opposed to the regular Vugraph files: namely, regular Vugraph files are an accurate record of the bids and the cards played, down to the last spot card; on the other hand, records in books almost always are vague as to spot cards. Hence, when the book says "Declarer drew trumps in two rounds", we usually do not know if he played the ace first or the king, or if the defenders followed with this or that low card; and usually it does not matter. When it matters, sources usually provide the relevant information.

In this match, two of the British pairs used highly artificial methods and we have tried where possible to highlight/explain these bids.

For the 1987 Bermuda Bowl our source was the official book published courtesy of the ACBL.

You may follow the actual play by pressing the Next Page button repeatedly. Alternatively at ANY stage in the play you can decide to play the cards yourself by clicking on the cards. BE WARNED however - once you enter this mode, you CANNOT revert reliably to the the actual play EXCEPT by pressing the Start of Deal button, thus going back to the start of trick 1.
