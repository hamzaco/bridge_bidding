nt|othered1: Hi, Jack!|pg||
nt|joest: many play that a preference there is almost artificial.  Obviously east-west fall into that camp|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: well it's a long shot but 15 imps out of the gate is a good start|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: 10 imp pickup on partscore hand is nice for Rogoff to find.  Now only need 51 more imps.|pg||

nt|joest: but not hugely|pg||
nt|othered1: North would like to make something happen, but what is there with bounds of sanity?|pg||
nt|joest: it depends on how 2NT would be read|pg||

nt|othered1: Was 1N just leaving room, preparatory to bidding it up later (opposite positive response)?|pg||

nt|joest: you can make this double dummy|pg||
nt|joest: maybe not even double dummy|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: so Rogoffs hand is a mystery while Parker's will be pretty well known.|pg||
nt|othered1: Isn't it easy in NT, double-dummy, just take 3@D tricks and endplay east in @C to play @H.  But that's not how you'd likely play the hand at the table|pg||
nt|jtr: Best contract i guess Given South would play @ss|pg||
nt|joest: it's possible robinson will lead a club on the go|pg||
nt|joest: you have an extra shot to ruff out @DQxx in 6@s|pg||

nt|othered1: Then you'll have a choice of rounded suits for your endplay|pg||
